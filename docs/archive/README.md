## Contents

### [sensors-satellite-comparison/](./sensors-satellite-comparison/)

## Purpose

The archive serves to:

- Preserve historical context for past decisions
- Keep reference material for solved problems
- Document deprecated features and why they were removed
- Maintain a record of completed investigations
- Avoid cluttering active documentation

## When to Archive

Move documentation to archive when:

- A feature has been removed or replaced
- An investigation is complete and issue is resolved
- Documentation is no longer actively maintained
- The content is historical but may be useful for reference

## Archive Organization

Archived documents maintain their original format and naming for easy reference. Related files should be grouped in subdirectories when appropriate.

## Retention Policy

Archived documents are kept indefinitely unless:

- They contain sensitive information (should be removed entirely)
- They are completely irrelevant to current and future development
- They are superseded by newer, more comprehensive documentation
